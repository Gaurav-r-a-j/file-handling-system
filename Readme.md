Using an absolute path in your current code folder instead of `os.tmpdir()` is perfectly fine for many use cases, but there are a few considerations to keep in mind before making this change:

### Advantages of Using `os.tmpdir()`

1. **System Compatibility:**  
   `os.tmpdir()` ensures that the temporary files are stored in a location appropriate for the operating system. This makes the application more portable across different environments (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).
2. **Auto-Cleanup by OS:**  
   Many operating systems automatically clean up their temporary directories periodically, so you don't have to worry about stale temporary files accumulating.

3. **No Need for Write Permissions:**  
   On some systems, your application might not have write permissions in certain directories. Using `os.tmpdir()` ensures your app can write without permission issues.

### Disadvantages of `os.tmpdir()`

1. **Unpredictable Paths:**  
   The path provided by `os.tmpdir()` can vary across different systems, making debugging or locating files manually more challenging.

2. **Manual Cleanup Required in Long-Running Apps:**  
   If your app generates many temporary files and runs for a long time, the OS might not clean them up automatically, requiring you to handle cleanup manually.

### Using an Absolute Path

If you decide to use an absolute path within your code folder, ensure you account for the following:

1. **Ensure Write Permissions:**  
   Make sure the directory you're using has write permissions. Use `fs.mkdir` with the `{ recursive: true }` option to create the directory if it doesn't exist.

2. **Security Considerations:**  
   Avoid exposing the directory to unauthorized users, as storing files in a predictable location might lead to security risks.

3. **Disk Space Management:**  
   Monitor and manage disk space manually if the files grow too large over time.

4. **Environment-Specific Pathing:**  
   If the application is deployed in different environments (e.g., local development, CI/CD, production), ensure the absolute path works consistently across those environments.

### Example Code with Absolute Path

Hereâ€™s how you can update your code to use an absolute path in your current code folder:

```typescript
const localDownloadDir = path.resolve(__dirname, "temporary-images");
export const squooshedImagesDir = path.resolve(__dirname, "squooshed-images");

private static async ensureDirectoriesExist(): Promise<void> {
  for (const dir of [localDownloadDir, squooshedImagesDir]) {
    await fs.mkdir(dir, { recursive: true });
  }
}
```

### Best Practice

For maximum flexibility:

- Use environment variables to define the directory path.
- Fall back to `os.tmpdir()` as a default if the environment variable is not set.

```typescript
const localDownloadDir =
  process.env.LOCAL_DOWNLOAD_DIR || path.resolve(__dirname, "temporary-images");
export const squooshedImagesDir =
  process.env.SQUOOSHED_IMAGES_DIR ||
  path.resolve(__dirname, "squooshed-images");
```

This approach allows developers to customize paths per environment while maintaining system compatibility.
